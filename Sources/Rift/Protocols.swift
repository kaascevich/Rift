///
/// To customize your type's `PartialEq` conformance, to adopt `PartialEq` in a
/// type that doesn't meet the criteria listed above, or to extend an existing

/// type, which calls the custom `==` function and negates its result.
///
/// As an example, consider a `StreetAddress` class that holds the parts of a

/// ```swift
/// class StreetAddress {
///     let number: String
///     let street: String
///     let unit: String?
///
///     init(_ number: String, _ street: String, unit: String? = nil) {
///         self.number = number
///         self.street = street
///         self.unit = unit
///     }

/// ```
///
/// Now suppose you have an array of addresses that you need to check for a

///
/// The identity of a class instance is not part of an instance's value.

///
/// ```swift
/// let a = IntegerRef(100)
/// let b = IntegerRef(100)
///
/// print(a == a, a == b, separator: ", ")
/// // Prints "true, true"
/// ```
///
/// Class instance identity, on the other hand, is compared using the

/// let c = a
/// print(c === a, c === b, separator: ", ")
/// // Prints "true, false"

/// relational operators or use standard library methods that are designed for
/// `PartialOrd` types.
///
/// The most familiar use of relational operators is to compare numbers, as in

///
/// ```swift
/// let currentTemp = 73
///
/// if currentTemp >= 90 {
///     print("It's a scorcher!")
/// } else if currentTemp < 65 {
///     print("Might need a sweater today.")
/// } else {
///     print("Seems like picnic weather!")
/// }
/// // Prints "Seems like picnic weather!"
/// ```
///
/// You can use special versions of some sequence and collection operations
/// when working with a `PartialOrd` type. For example, if your array's
/// elements conform to `PartialOrd`, you can call the `sort()` method without
/// using arguments to sort the elements of your array in ascending order.
///
/// ```swift
/// var measurements = [1.1, 1.5, 2.9, 1.2, 1.5, 1.3, 1.2]
/// measurements.sort()
/// print(measurements)
/// // Prints "[1.1, 1.2, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5, 1.5, 2.9]"
/// ```
///
/// # Conforming to the PartialOrd Protocol
///
/// Types with `PartialOrd` conformance implement the less-than operator (`<`)
/// and the equal-to operator (`==`). These two operations impose a strict
/// total order on the values of a type, in which exactly one of the following
/// must be true for any two values `a` and `b`:
///
/// - `a == b`
/// - `a < b`
/// - `b < a`
///
/// In addition, the following conditions must hold:
///
/// - `a < a` is always `false` (Irreflexivity)
/// - `a < b` implies `!(b < a)` (Asymmetry)
/// - `a < b` and `b < c` implies `a < c` (Transitivity)
///
/// To add `PartialOrd` conformance to your custom types, define the `<` and
/// `==` operators as static methods of your types. The `==` operator is a
/// requirement of the `Eq` protocol, which `PartialOrd` extends -- see that
/// protocol's documentation for more information about equality in Swift.
/// Because default implementations of the remainder of the relational
/// operators are provided by the standard library, you'll be able to use
/// `!=`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` with instances of your type without any further
/// code.
///
/// As an example, here's an implementation of a `Date` structure that stores
/// the year, month, and day of a date:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Date {
///     let year: isize
///     let month: isize
///     let day: isize
/// }
/// ```
///
/// To add `PartialOrd` conformance to `Date`, first declare conformance to
/// `PartialOrd` and implement the `<` operator function.
///
/// ```swift
/// extension Date: PartialOrd {
///     static func < (lhs: Date, rhs: Date) -> bool {
///         if lhs.year != rhs.year {
///             return lhs.year < rhs.year
///         } else if lhs.month != rhs.month {
///             return lhs.month < rhs.month
///         } else {
///             return lhs.day < rhs.day
///         }
///     }
/// ```
///
/// This function uses the least specific nonmatching property of the date to
/// determine the result of the comparison. For example, if the two `year`
/// properties are equal but the two `month` properties are not, the date with
/// the lesser value for `month` is the lesser of the two dates.
///
/// Next, implement the `==` operator function, the requirement inherited from
/// the `Eq` protocol.
///
/// ```swift
///     static func == (lhs: Date, rhs: Date) -> bool {
///         return lhs.year == rhs.year && lhs.month == rhs.month
///             && lhs.day == rhs.day
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Two `Date` instances are equal if each of their corresponding properties are
/// equal.
///
/// Now that `Date` conforms to `PartialOrd`, you can compare instances of the
/// type with any of the relational operators. The following example compares
/// the date of the first moon landing with the release of David Bowie's song
/// "Space Oddity":
///
/// ```swift
/// let spaceOddity = Date(year: 1969, month: 7, day: 11)   // July 11, 1969
/// let moonLanding = Date(year: 1969, month: 7, day: 20)   // July 20, 1969
/// if moonLanding > spaceOddity {
///     print("Major Tom stepped through the door first.")
/// } else {
///     print("David Bowie was following in Neil Armstrong's footsteps.")
/// }
/// // Prints "Major Tom stepped through the door first."
/// ```
///
/// Note that the `>` operator provided by the standard library is used in this
/// example, not the `<` operator implemented above.
///
/// - Note: A conforming type may contain a subset of values which are treated
///   as exceptional -- that is, values that are outside the domain of
///   meaningful arguments for the purposes of the `PartialOrd` protocol. For
///   example, the special "not a number" value for floating-point types
///   (`FloatingPoint.nan`) compares as neither less than, greater than, nor
///   equal to any normal floating-point value. Exceptional values need not
///   take part in the strict total order.

///
/// Your own custom types can be hashable as well. When you define an
